# `/helpers` Directory usage

This directory **should contain utility functions and helper modules**. 

For example, if you have a function called `formatDate()` that does the formatting of the displaying date, you should put that function under this directory. 

Besides, any helper module declaration like `db` (if using Prisma), `auth` (if using NextAuth) should be also in this directory.
