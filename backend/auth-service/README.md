## Set up

To set up `auth-service` locally, first create a `.env` file directly under `/auth-service`. Ensure that your `.env` file contains all the environmental variables listed below:

```sh
SERVICE_PORT=5050

JWT_SECRET=<COPY_JWT_SECRET_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SECRET=<COPY_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SECRET_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>
EMAIL_RESET_SECRET=<COPY_EMAIL_RESET_SECRET_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>
SERVICE_SECRET=<COPY_SERVICE_SECRET_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>

NM_MAIL="peerprep01@gmail.com"
NM_PASS=<COPY_NM_PASS_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>
DATABASE_URL=<COPY_DATABASE_URL_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>
```

## Running the service

To run the auth service locally, first run `npm i` directly under the `/auth-service` directory to install the relevant dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` in the same directory.

There are multiple API endpoints available, you may find the detailed documentation of each endpoint in the below section.

## Endpoint and usage

### `GET /auth/api/health`

This endpoint helps ping the API server and the database connected to ensure it is working perfectly.

**Example**

```
GET http://localhost:5050/auth/api/health
```

**Response**

```
status: 200 OK
{
  message: "Healthy"
}
```

**Possible Status Code**
| Status Code | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | The API server is connected to the database and is working |
| 500 | The API server/database ran into a problem |

### `GET /auth/api/verifyResetPasswordLinkValidity/:userId/:token`

This endpoint helps to verify that the reset password link is valid for the certain user.

**Example**

```
GET http://localhost:5050/auth/api/verifyResetPasswordLinkValidity/cln7j90c3000125d0t5jl69jw/randomtoken
```

**Response**

```
status: 403 FORBIDDEN
{
    "error": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "This reset password link is invalid."
}
```

**Possible Status Code**
| Status Code | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | The reset password link is valid |
| 403 | The reset passsword link is invalid |

### `POST /auth/api/registerByEmail`

This endpoint is used to register a new user by email.

Note that in our implementation, the password should be hashed in the frontend before sending to this endpoint. Therefore, even though a new user can be created using this endpoint directly, this password cannot be used to log in the user through the endpoint [`POST /auth/api/loginByEmail`](#post-authapiloginbyemail), as the password will not pass our validity check.

**IMPORTANT:** This endpoint will call the user service internally. Therefore, make sure that the user service is running before calling this endpoint, else the server will always return error code 500.

**Request Body Format**
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| email | string | The email of the user, must be unique |
| name | string | The name of the user |
| password | string | The hashed password set by the user |
| role | Role | The role of the user, either "user" or "admin" |

**Request**

```
PUT http://localhost:5050/auth/api/registerByEmail

Request Body:
{
    "email": "newuser@mail.com",
    "password": "password",
    "name": "new user",
    "role": "user"
}
```

**Response**

```
status: 201 Created
{
    "success": true,
    "userId": "clofmzchr000025820o6r4ujr"
}
```

**Possible Status Code**
| Status Code | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| 201 | The user was registered successfully |
| 400 | The given request body is invalid |
| 409 | The given user email is already taken |
| 500 | The user service is not running |

### `POST /auth/api/loginByEmail`

This endpoint is used to log in a user by email. After calling this endpoint, a HTTP-Only cookie containing a JWT token will be attached to the response header, which will authenticate the user for subsequent endpoint calls that require user authentication.

Note that in our implementation, the password should be hashed in the frontend before sending to this endpoint. Therefore, even though a new user can be created using the endpoint [`POST /auth/api/registerByEmail`](#post-authapiregisterbyemail) directly, the password used to register cannot be used to log in the user through this endpoint, as the password will not pass our validity check.

**Request Body Format**
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| email | string | The email of the user |
| password | string | The hashed password set by the user |

**Request**

```
