## Set up

To set up `user-service` locally, we will need to create a `.env` file directly under `/user-service`. Ensure that you have all the environmental variables listed below:

```sh
SERVICE_PORT=5005
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=debug
DATABASE_URL=<COPY_DATABASE_URL_FROM_ENV_FILE_SECRETS>
```

## Running the service

To run the user service locally, run `npm run dev` directly under the `/user-service` directory.

There are multiple API endpoints available, you may find the detailed documentation of each endpoint in below section.

**IMPORTANT:** All the user service endpoints, other than [`GET /user/api/health`](#GETuserapihealth) are protected, which means that they require a valid JWT token embedded inside a HTTP-Only cookie within the request header. To authenticate yourself, please refer to the `README.md` under `../auth-service`.
